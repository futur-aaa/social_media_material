🔊 📝 artist preview: @trauma.zone is a duo of a media and a sound artist based between Berlin and Leipzig, Germany. We create live performances and installations using Pure Data and TouchDesigner.

Ksenia Sova (@ksenysova) — media artist, route setter for a climbing gym and a Rosa Luxemburg scholarship recipient. They currently study media art in Hochschule für Grafik und Buchkunst in Leipzig. 

Fyodor Stepanov (@fyodor.st) —sound aritst, mainly working with field recordings and live coding. He studied composition at Jazz Insitut Berlin and has many years of professional experience as a double bass player in a range of genres between classical/baroque and contemporary music. 

In our works we’re interested to approach critically the methodology of statistical data collection, which raises question of what should be considered “normal”, “common sense” or “scientifically proofed”.
