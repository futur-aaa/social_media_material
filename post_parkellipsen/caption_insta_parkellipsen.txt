artist preview: parkellipsen plays a style of music that depends on the situation.

parkellipsen, aka Niklas Reppel (he/him), is (in no particular order) a programmer, live coder, sound artist, composer, and musician.
He's currently based in Barcelona. His algorave performances are somewhat eclectic, mostly upbeat, and always danceable. Sometimes they sound a bit like Footwork, sometimes a bit like Drum&Bass, and sometimes like a free jazz drummer playing on a TR909. Sometimes they contain the occasional cover song or a cartoon quote. Algoraves were invented, after all, (or so live coding lore has it) to make live coding more fun for audience and performer.
