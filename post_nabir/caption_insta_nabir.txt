artist preview: @nabir___ plays melodic IDM and ambient techno.

Nabìr is the solo project of Rome-based audio + visual artist Lorenzo Berretti. Nabìr employs live coding on TidalCycles and SuperCollider with handmade cassette tape loops to create imaginative soundscapes and nostalgic atmospheres. Both the music and the visuals are conceived as a warm and welcoming hug, a flood of memories that passes through the lenses of digital and computer manipulation.
