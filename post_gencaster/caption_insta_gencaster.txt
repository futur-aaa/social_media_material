artist preview: @party1999 plays Algorithmic Compositions.

Dennis Scheiba (GenCaster) is an audio-visual artist with an interest in critical reflection upon technology and algorithms and their political impact on society. In his livecoding practice he attempts to diverge from traditional club vocabulary and constructs them from a synthesis-first perspective that entangles the construction of sound and vision, which is strongly influenced by spectralism and radical constructivism.
